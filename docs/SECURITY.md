## Security Considerations

### Data Handling

1. **No Sensitive Data Storage:**
   - No user credentials stored
   - No personal information collected
   - All data sourced from public SEC EDGAR

2. **Network Security:**
   - HTTPS used for SEC API calls
   - No authentication required
   - Rate limiting implemented

3. **Input Validation:**
   - Ticker symbols sanitized
   - CIK numbers validated
   - JSON responses parsed safely

### Known Limitations

1. **Local Server:**
   - Default configuration binds to localhost only
   - Not designed for production deployment
   - No built-in authentication

2. **Cache:**
   - Cached data stored in memory
   - No encryption of cached data
   - Cache cleared on restart
