## 2. History of Financial Fraud Detection Systems

### 2.1 Early Fraud Detection (Pre-1990s)

Financial fraud detection has existed as long as financial markets themselves. Early methods relied primarily on:

- **Manual Auditing**: Accountants and auditors manually reviewed financial statements for inconsistencies
- **Ratio Analysis**: Basic financial ratios were compared against industry benchmarks
- **Red Flag Checklists**: Auditors used experience-based checklists to identify suspicious patterns
- **Whistleblower Reports**: Many frauds were detected through tips from employees or competitors

Notable early frauds that shaped detection practices:

| Year | Company | Amount | Impact |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| 1938 | McKesson & Robbins | $19M | Led to mandatory independent audits |
| 1973 | Equity Funding Corp | $2B | Highlighted need for computer auditing |
| 1982 | ZZZZ Best | $100M | Exposed audit procedure weaknesses |

### 2.2 Statistical Revolution (1990s-2000s)

The 1990s saw the emergence of quantitative fraud detection models:

**1994 - Beneish M-Score**
Professor Messod Beneish of Indiana University developed the M-Score model, using eight financial variables to calculate the probability of earnings manipulation. This model successfully identified Enron as a potential manipulator before its collapse.

**1968/1983 - Altman Z-Score**
While originally developed by Edward Altman in 1968 for bankruptcy prediction, the Z-Score became widely used in the 1990s as a fraud indicator, as companies approaching financial distress often resort to fraudulent reporting.

**2000 - Piotroski F-Score**
Joseph Piotroski developed the F-Score at the University of Chicago to identify financially strong companies, but it also serves as a fraud detection tool by highlighting companies with deteriorating fundamentals.

### 2.3 Modern Quantitative Era (2000s-Present)

Major corporate scandals drove innovation in fraud detection:

| Year | Company | Fraud Amount | Key Issue |
|------|---------|--------------|-----------|
| 2001 | Enron | $74B loss | Off-balance-sheet entities |
| 2002 | WorldCom | $11B | Capitalized operating expenses |
| 2002 | Tyco | $600M | Executive theft |
| 2003 | HealthSouth | $2.7B | Inflated earnings |
| 2008 | Lehman Brothers | $50B | Hidden leverage |

These scandals resulted in:
- Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) mandating internal controls
- PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) creation
- Enhanced SEC enforcement capabilities
- Growth of forensic accounting as a profession
- Development of automated fraud detection systems

### 2.4 Regulatory Response and Technology

Modern fraud detection benefits from:

- **XBRL Reporting**: Standardized financial data since 2009
- **SEC EDGAR System**: Electronic filing and public access
- **Machine Learning**: Pattern recognition in large datasets
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous analysis of filings
- **Big Data Analytics**: Cross-referencing multiple data sources

## 6. Design Philosophy

### 6.1 Multi-Model Approach

Financial fraud is complex and multifaceted. No single model captures all indicators. This system combines five complementary models:

| Model | Focus Area | Default Weight |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| Beneish M-Score | Earnings manipulation | 30% |
| Altman Z-Score | Financial distress | 25% |
| Piotroski F-Score | Financial strength | 15% |
| Fraud Triangle | Behavioral factors | 15% |
| Benford's Law | Digit distribution | 5% |
| Red Flags | Qualitative indicators | 10% |

### 6.2 Transparency and Explainability

Unlike "black box" machine learning systems, this analyzer provides:

- **Component Scores**: Each model's contribution is visible
- **Calculation Details**: Full breakdown of each metric
- **Threshold Explanations**: Why a score triggers an alert
- **Historical Context**: Comparison with prior periods
- **Source Data**: Links to original SEC filings

### 6.3 Real-Time Data Integration

The system fetches live data from SEC EDGAR:

- **Current Filings**: Analyzes most recent 10-K and 10-Q
- **Historical Comparison**: Trends over multiple periods
- **Automatic Updates**: No manual data entry required
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects SEC API guidelines (10 req/sec)
- **Caching**: Reduces redundant API calls

### 6.4 Conservative Risk Assessment

The system errs on the side of caution:

- **False Positives Preferred**: Better to investigate than miss fraud
- **Weighted Thresholds**: Multiple indicators needed for high risk
- **Uncertainty Handling**: Missing data increases risk score
- **Clear Disclaimers**: Not a substitute for professional analysis

### 6.5 Modern C++ Standards

Technical design principles:

- **C++20 Features**: Modern language features where beneficial
- **Memory Safety**: Smart pointers and RAII throughout
- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent request handling
- **Platform Abstraction**: Clean separation of OS-specific code
- **No External Dependencies**: Standard library only

## 7. Fraud Detection Models Implemented

### 7.1 Beneish M-Score

**Purpose**: Detect earnings manipulation

**Formula**:
```
M = -4.84 + 0.92*DSRI + 0.528*GMI + 0.404*AQI + 0.892*SGI
    + 0.115*DEPI - 0.172*SGAI + 4.679*TATA - 0.327*LVGI
```

**Variables**:

| Variable | Name | Calculation |
|----------|------|-------------|
| DSRI | Days Sales Receivables Index | (Receivables/Sales)t / (Receivables/Sales)t-1 |
| GMI | Gross Margin Index | Gross Margint-1 / Gross Margint |
| AQI | Asset Quality Index | Asset Quality change |
| SGI | Sales Growth Index | Salest / Salest-1 |
| DEPI | Depreciation Index | Depreciation rate change |
| SGAI | SG&A Index | SG&A expense ratio change |
| TATA | Total Accruals to Assets | Accruals / Total Assets |
| LVGI | Leverage Index | Leverage ratio change |

**Interpretation**:
- M > -1.78: High probability of manipulation
- M < -2.22: Low probability of manipulation

### 7.2 Altman Z-Score

**Purpose**: Predict financial distress (often precedes fraud)

**Formula**:
```
Z = 1.2*A + 1.4*B + 3.3*C + 0.6*D + 1.0*E
```

**Variables**:

| Variable | Calculation |
|----------|-------------|
| A | Working Capital / Total Assets |
| B | Retained Earnings / Total Assets |
| C | EBIT / Total Assets |
| D | Market Value Equity / Total Liabilities |
| E | Sales / Total Assets |

**Interpretation**:
- Z > 2.99: Safe zone
- Z 1.81-2.99: Grey zone
- Z < 1.81: Distress zone

### 7.3 Piotroski F-Score

**Purpose**: Assess financial strength

**Scoring**: 0-9 points based on nine criteria

| # | Criterion | Points |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Positive net income | 0 or 1 |
| 2 | Positive operating cash flow | 0 or 1 |
| 3 | Increasing ROA | 0 or 1 |
| 4 | Cash flow > Net income | 0 or 1 |
| 5 | Decreasing long-term debt ratio | 0 or 1 |
| 6 | Increasing current ratio | 0 or 1 |
| 7 | No new shares issued | 0 or 1 |
| 8 | Increasing gross margin | 0 or 1 |
| 9 | Increasing asset turnover | 0 or 1 |

**Interpretation**:
- 8-9: Strong financial health
- 4-7: Average
- 0-3: Weak (fraud risk indicator)

### 7.4 Fraud Triangle Analysis

**Purpose**: Assess behavioral fraud indicators

**Components**:

**Pressure (Incentive):**
- Executive compensation tied to stock price
- Debt covenants near violation
- Analyst expectations to meet
- Cash flow problems

**Opportunity:**
- Weak internal controls
- Complex transactions
- Related party dealings
- Management override capability

**Rationalization:**
- Aggressive accounting policies
- History of restatements
- Auditor disagreements
- Tone at the top issues

### 7.5 Benford's Law Analysis

**Purpose**: Detect artificial number generation

**Principle**: In naturally occurring datasets, leading digits follow a specific distribution:

| Digit | Expected Frequency |
|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | 30.1% |
| 2 | 17.6% |
| 3 | 12.5% |
| 4 | 9.7% |
| 5 | 7.9% |
| 6 | 6.7% |
| 7 | 5.8% |
| 8 | 5.1% |
| 9 | 4.6% |

**Application**: Financial statement numbers should follow this distribution. Significant deviation suggests fabrication.
