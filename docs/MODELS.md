## 1. Overview

This application implements five academically-validated fraud detection models. Each model examines different aspects of financial health and manipulation risk.

| Model | Focus | Original Author | Year |
|-------|-------|-----------------|------|
| Beneish M-Score | Earnings manipulation | Messod Beneish | 1999 |
| Altman Z-Score | Bankruptcy risk | Edward Altman | 1968 |
| Piotroski F-Score | Financial strength | Joseph Piotroski | 2000 |
| Benford's Law | Number patterns | Frank Benford | 1938 |
| Fraud Triangle | Behavioral factors | Donald Cressey | 1953 |

## 2. Beneish M-Score

### Purpose

Detect earnings manipulation by analyzing financial statement ratios.

### Formula

```
M = -4.84 + 0.92*DSRI + 0.528*GMI + 0.404*AQI + 0.892*SGI
    + 0.115*DEPI - 0.172*SGAI + 4.679*TATA - 0.327*LVGI
```

### Variables

| Variable | Name | Formula | Interpretation |
|----------|------|---------|----------------|
| DSRI | Days Sales Receivables Index | (Receivables_t/Sales_t) / (Receivables_t-1/Sales_t-1) | >1.0 suggests revenue inflation |
| GMI | Gross Margin Index | GrossMargin_t-1 / GrossMargin_t | >1.0 suggests margin deterioration |
| AQI | Asset Quality Index | [1-(CA_t+PPE_t)/TA_t] / [1-(CA_t-1+PPE_t-1)/TA_t-1] | >1.0 suggests asset quality decline |
| SGI | Sales Growth Index | Sales_t / Sales_t-1 | High growth increases manipulation risk |
| DEPI | Depreciation Index | DepRate_t-1 / DepRate_t | >1.0 suggests slower depreciation |
| SGAI | SG&A Index | (SGA_t/Sales_t) / (SGA_t-1/Sales_t-1) | >1.0 suggests cost pressure |
| TATA | Total Accruals to Assets | (Income - CFO) / TotalAssets | High accruals suggest manipulation |
| LVGI | Leverage Index | Leverage_t / Leverage_t-1 | >1.0 suggests increasing debt |

### Interpretation

| M-Score | Risk Level | Meaning |
|---------|------------|---------|
| > -1.78 | HIGH | Likely manipulator (76% accuracy) |
| -1.78 to -2.22 | MODERATE | Borderline |
| < -2.22 | LOW | Unlikely manipulator |

### Historical Performance

- Successfully flagged Enron before collapse
- Successfully flagged WorldCom before collapse
- 76% accuracy in academic studies

## 3. Altman Z-Score

### Purpose

Predict bankruptcy risk. Financial distress often precedes or accompanies fraud.

### Formula

```
Z = 1.2*A + 1.4*B + 3.3*C + 0.6*D + 1.0*E
```

### Variables

| Variable | Formula | Weight | Measures |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|
| A | Working Capital / Total Assets | 1.2 | Liquidity |
| B | Retained Earnings / Total Assets | 1.4 | Cumulative profitability |
| C | EBIT / Total Assets | 3.3 | Operating efficiency |
| D | Market Value Equity / Total Liabilities | 0.6 | Solvency |
| E | Sales / Total Assets | 1.0 | Asset utilization |

### Interpretation

| Z-Score | Zone | Probability of Bankruptcy |
|---------|------|---------------------------|
| > 2.99 | Safe | Very low |
| 1.81 - 2.99 | Grey | Uncertain |
| < 1.81 | Distress | High |

### Variations

- **Original (1968):** For manufacturing companies
- **Z'-Score:** For private companies (removes market value)
- **Z''-Score:** For non-manufacturing/emerging markets

This implementation uses the original formula.

## 4. Piotroski F-Score

### Purpose

Evaluate financial strength through nine binary criteria.

### Scoring (0-9 points)

#### Profitability (0-4 points)

| # | Criterion | Condition for 1 Point |
|---|-----------|----------------------|
| 1 | ROA | Net Income > 0 |
| 2 | CFO | Operating Cash Flow > 0 |
| 3 | Delta ROA | ROA_t > ROA_t-1 |
| 4 | Accruals | CFO > Net Income |

#### Leverage/Liquidity (0-3 points)

| # | Criterion | Condition for 1 Point |
|---|-----------|----------------------|
| 5 | Delta Leverage | LTDebt/Assets_t < LTDebt/Assets_t-1 |
| 6 | Delta Liquidity | CurrentRatio_t > CurrentRatio_t-1 |
| 7 | Equity Offering | No new shares issued |

#### Operating Efficiency (0-2 points)

| # | Criterion | Condition for 1 Point |
|---|-----------|----------------------|
| 8 | Delta Margin | GrossMargin_t > GrossMargin_t-1 |
| 9 | Delta Turnover | AssetTurnover_t > AssetTurnover_t-1 |

### Interpretation

| F-Score | Rating | Meaning |
|---------|--------|---------|
| 8-9 | Strong | Excellent financial health |
| 5-7 | Moderate | Average financial health |
| 0-4 | Weak | Poor financial health, fraud risk |

---

## 5. Benford's Law Analysis

### Purpose

Detect artificially generated numbers by analyzing digit distribution.

### Principle

In naturally occurring datasets, leading digits follow a predictable distribution:

| Digit | Expected % | Formula |
|-------|------------|---------|
| 1 | 30.1% | log10(1 + 1/d) |
| 2 | 17.6% | log10(1 + 1/d) |
| 3 | 12.5% | log10(1 + 1/d) |
| 4 | 9.7% | log10(1 + 1/d) |
| 5 | 7.9% | log10(1 + 1/d) |
| 6 | 6.7% | log10(1 + 1/d) |
| 7 | 5.8% | log10(1 + 1/d) |
| 8 | 5.1% | log10(1 + 1/d) |
| 9 | 4.6% | log10(1 + 1/d) |

### Statistical Test

Chi-square test compares observed vs. expected frequencies:

```
X^2 = Sum[(Observed - Expected)^2 / Expected]
```

### Interpretation

| Deviation | Risk Level | Meaning |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| < 10% | LOW | Normal distribution |
| 10-20% | MODERATE | Monitor for anomalies |
| > 20% | HIGH | Possible fabrication |

### Limitations

- Requires sufficient data points (50+ recommended)
- Some legitimate datasets don't follow Benford's Law
- Best used with other indicators

|--------|-----------|
| Financial targets | Executive compensation tied to stock |
| Debt covenants | Near covenant violation |
| Analyst expectations | Consistent "just meeting" estimates |
| Cash flow issues | Operating cash flow negative |
| Competition | Market share declining |

#### Opportunity - Weight: 40%

| Factor | Indicator |
|--------|-----------|
| Internal controls | Audit opinion qualified |

|--------|-----------|
| Accounting policies | Aggressive revenue recognition |

### Interpretation

|-------|------------|
| 0-30% | LOW |
| 31-60% | MODERATE |
| 61-100% | HIGH |

---

## 7. Combined Risk Score

### Calculation

The overall risk score combines individual model outputs:

```
Overall = w1*Beneish + w2*Altman + w3*Piotroski + w4*Benford + w5*FraudTriangle
```

### Default Weights

| Model | Weight | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Beneish M-Score | 30% | Direct manipulation detection |
| Altman Z-Score | 25% | Financial distress indicator |
| Piotroski F-Score | 15% | Financial strength |
| Fraud Triangle | 15% | Behavioral factors |
| Benford's Law | 5% | Pattern detection |
| Red Flags | 10% | Qualitative indicators |

### Risk Levels

| Score | Level | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 0-25 | LOW | Minimal concern |
| 26-50 | MODERATE | Further investigation recommended |
| 51-75 | HIGH | Significant red flags |
| 76-100 | CRITICAL | Strong manipulation indicators |

## 8. Limitations

### Model Limitations

1. **Historical basis:** Models based on past fraud may miss new schemes
2. **Industry variations:** Some industries naturally show different patterns
3. **Size effects:** Large vs. small companies behave differently
4. **International:** Models developed for US GAAP

### Data Limitations

1. **XBRL coverage:** Not all companies use same concepts
2. **Timing:** Recent filings may lack complete data
3. **Restatements:** Historical data may change

### Important Disclaimers

1. **Not definitive:** High scores don't prove fraud
2. **False positives:** Legitimate companies may score high
3. **False negatives:** Sophisticated fraud may evade detection
4. **Professional advice:** Consult experts for investment decisions
